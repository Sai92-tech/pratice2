ansible files

### Ansible is a configuration management tool
### we use with ansible tool to connect one server to another server and maintaine playbooks

###### Basic configaration
create a instance 3 r 4 ---> After Created instances we configure a Ansible master  .. where is ansible installed that server work as a MASTER
sudo apt-get update           :: To Update the server
sudo adduser <username>       :: To Create a User
Enter The password
sudo su <username>            :: Switch to Normal User to Root User
In Root User Apt install Ansible :: To Ansible install in Servers
Ansible --version                :: To know the version
Once ansible Installed there is a so many  file as Per understand for Better way we can Create two Files For Run the All commmands 
1st One is  vi <ansible.cfg>
In above file must have these line    [headers]
                   2nd line           host_key_check = False    ###To config the file
2nd One is vi <inventory>
In above inventory File  we must maintaned a server ip Addrees    [webserver]
                                                                   ip  ###u can mainataine n no of Servers

### To connect one server to another server thare are two types

#### One is SSH Password Authentication ----> Process is Given Below
After user Creation 
sudo vi /etc/sudoers --->>> In this file there is root ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL line is here Next Below u can write
sai ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
Then 
Sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd-config -->>  file Open in this file 
no passwordauthentication YES     ### bY defalut no is here we change into YES
sudo systemctl restart sshd     --->>> after excute these command changes will be applicable
<username@serverIP>: ssh <username@Nodeip>    ----->> this is login slave nodes from Master node same Process must to do all server 

### 2nd in SSH Password less authentication
<username@serverip> ssh-keygen         ::: To run this keypair helps connect oneserver to another server
AFter .ssh direcory added 
<username@serverip> : cd .ssh          ---->> To Go to that Directory
Here is a Keys public key and Private key and remain
<username@serverip>: .ssh: Lets Excute this command is <ssh-copy-id username@slaveip>
Thats is ssh key added to the slave server and its connected 
To Verify The connection is enbled r not   ::: <username@serverip> : ssh username@slaveip  -->> this connection checking process is all the same for all salve ips
Must nd should we login and logout process can do how many servers u have to do in all those servers

##### In those servers we must mention a Inventory file
vi inventory
[webserver]     ### fOR example servers
10.0.0.0
1.1.1.1
2.2.2.2
After Mentoned the password this command will be excute
<ansible -i inventory -m ping all>       : To check the servers


### To write a playbook for Apache2 
vi apache.yml                      :::: yaml playbooks extenstions must be .yml
---
- hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
  - name: install apache
    apt:
      name: apache2
      state: present
:wq! To save & exit the file
ansible-playbook apache.yml -i inventory      :: this command is helps file exution

#### To Install A java By Use Yml playbook
vi java.yaml
---
- hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
  - name: install jre 
    apt:
      name: default-jre OR opendk-8-jre

    apt: 
      name: default-jdk OR openjdk-8-jdk
      state: present

ansible-playbook java.yml -i inventory     :: file will be excuted

#### To Install jenkins By useing yaml Playbook

    become: yes
    regisrot: admin_pass

  - degug: var="admin_pass.stdout_lines + [admin_pass.sderr]"     ####this is is a standred syntax for jenkins page opening
    
ansible-playbook jenkins.yml -i inventory   ::: lets excute this file

#### ad-hook commands for ansible
uptime                                        :: its shows server timeing details
free -m                                       :: its shows which memory u have data
ansible -i inventory <slaveip> -m shell -a "uptime"          :::: this is command is use for specific server uptimes 
ansible -i inventory <serverips groupname> -m shell -a "uptime"   ::: this is command is used for group of servers excusted
ansible -i inventory <onegroup:2ndgroup> -m shell -a "uptime"      ::: this command uses multiple groups uptime lists
ansible -i ineventory <serverip> -m command -a "apt install apache2 -b"   ::Install apache2 by using ad-hook command
ansible -i inventory <server ip OR group ip> -m apt -a "name=nginx state=present" -b :: Install nginx by using ad-hook command

## To Create a password for ansible playbook 
Command is ---->>>> ansible-vault edit --vault-id @prompt <playbook name>  : This is for exsiting palybook
Command is ---->>>> ansible-vault create --vault-id @prompt <laybook name>  : This is for Creating new palybook  
Command is ---->>>> ansible-vault view --vault-id @prompt <palybook name>   : This is used for just view the palybook 
Command is ---->>>> ansible-vault encrypt --vault-id @ prompt <Palybook name> : it hepls playbook content encrypted
Command is ---->>>> ansible-vault rekey --ask-vault-pass <playbook name>    ::: it helps to change a existing password
Command is ---->>>> ansible-vault decrypt --ask-vault-pass <palybook name>  :: To Remove our playbook Pasword
if Ansible palybook has a password how to excute the palybook and command is 
ansible-playbook --vault-id @prompt <palybook name> -i inventory :: 
 ### To addto role and Create a role
ansible-galaxy init <rolename>       :: This command is used to Create a New Role
cd <rolename (tomcat)>:               :: To Change Directory into Role name tomcat
ls                                     :: list of the file in role name
mkdir template                         :: To Create a our own Directory in Tomcat Roll name To Maintaine a files
cd handlers                            :: Change directory into Handlers
Thare is one main.yml file we need to change this --->>> Into main.yml we have to write a ansible palybook content
---
- name: restart tomcat
  service:
    name: tomcat
    state: restarted
:wq!       To save and exit the handlers file
Then Go to Tasks folder  ----  >>>>> cd tasks  --->>>> Thare is a file on the name of main.yml (here is mentione what do u want to write palybook)
vi main.yml
